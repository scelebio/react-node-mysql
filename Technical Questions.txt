Technical questions

1-)What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

React - Node - MySQL

2-)What's the command to start the application locally?


3-)How long did you spend on the coding project? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 
If you didn't spend much time on the coding project, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spent 6 nights. This is my first fullstack experience. I had no prior React experience. A React-Node application was in my "to-practice" list. This turned out a nice start. Thank you.

4-)What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? 
Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
I think the most useful, magical and tricky part is the Router.

 
        <Router>
        <Route path="/" exact>
        <button onClick={()=> {
        Axios.post('http://localhost:3001/login', 
        {username: username, 
          password: password,
      }).then((response) => {
        if (response.data.message) {
          setLoginStatus(response.data.message);
        } else {
          setLoginStatus(response.data[0].username)
          setIsAuth(true)
      }
        
      });
    }}> login </button>



    <Link to='/profile'> Go to Profile</Link>
    </Route>
    <ProtectedRoute path="/profile" component={Profile} IsAuth={IsAuth} />
  </Router>



5-)How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Normally, I am using git and "git push" through the terminal to track down what has been done.
I didn't use git on this project even though I had some other projects on my github account.
